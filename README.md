Hi everyone. As you can see, Iâ€™m now certified with a Masters in Data Science with Power BI (with Generative AI). I received the certification from Console Flare. I learned about data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence, among other things.

I am also skilled in the following technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, PySpark, DataBricks, and many others. I have also developed prediction models based on real-world datasets using statistical and machine learning techniques. I also know how to create interactive reports and dashboards using Power BI.
